In rare cases shingles can cause pain without a rash.</p><p data-block-key="d53wd">Usually you get the shingles rash on your chest and tummy, but it can appear anywhere on your body including on your face, eyes and genitals.</p><p data-block-key="7gcbe">The rash appears as blotches on your skin, on 1 side of your body only. A rash on both the left and right of your body is unlikely to be shingles.</p>
